## Introduction

Image restoration, aimed at recovering high-quality image content from degraded versions, has numerous applications, including photography, security, medical imaging, and remote sensing. In this example, we implement the **MIRNet** model for low-light image enhancementâ€”a fully-convolutional architecture designed to learn enriched features that combine contextual information from multiple scales while preserving high-resolution spatial details.
