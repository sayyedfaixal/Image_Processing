## Introduction

With the goal of recovering high-quality image content from its degraded version, image
restoration enjoys numerous applications, such as in
photography, security, medical imaging, and remote sensing. In this example, we implement the
**MIRNet** model for low-light image enhancement, a fully-convolutional architecture that
learns an enriched set of
features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while
simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details.
